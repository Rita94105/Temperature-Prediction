# Temperature-Prediction
Assuming the formula for temperature conversion is unknown, linear regression is employed to derive the formula for converting Fahrenheit to Celsius. Additionally, the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) with Backpropagation (BP) is employed to learn and predict Celsius temperatures.
